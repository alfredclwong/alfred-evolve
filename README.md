TODO
- generic analyses
- circle packing analyses
- wandb logging
- check for unevaluated (low prio)
- have a think about generations and migrations
  - if you don't improve on the parent score, the generation will not advance
  - the island can be stagnant until a neigbouring island that is improving migrates its elite
- config saving
- map elites: time remaining, diversity, simplicity
